# Prepare worktree

Provision a git worktree the agent (or human) can `cd` into and immediately `lint` / `test` / `build` / `migrate` / `run` against — without touching the main checkout, and without colliding with any other live worktree on the same machine.

A bare `git worktree add` is not enough. The runnable parts of any non-trivial app live in *ignored* files and dirs (`node_modules/`, `.env*`, `venv/`, `vendor/`, local SQLite DBs, `.localstack/`, `docker-compose.override.yml`, etc.). This skill walks those ignored paths and decides, per-path:

- **Symlink** — when the file/dir is read-only-ish from the feature's perspective (dep install with no new deps, a frozen `.envrc`, a static fixture set).
- **Copy** — when the feature mutates it (`node_modules/` for a `pnpm add`, `.env` for a new var, the migrations dir).
- **Fork** — when sharing would corrupt the main checkout's state (`db.sqlite3`, a local Postgres DB used by tests, a docker-compose project name).

The output is a worktree that is the **same shape as the main checkout** from the perspective of every dev command in the project, plus a short summary file recording every fork decision so teardown is mechanical.

## When to use

- A plan / spec that takes hours-to-days where parallel work in the main checkout would be disruptive (a long migration, a refactor, a feature you want to experiment on while still serving customer support out of `main`).
- Two-or-more concurrent plans where each needs its own running app + own DB state.
- A risky migration where the user wants the migration to run against a forked DB, then walk the diff before promoting.
- [implement-plan](../implement-plan/SKILL.md) Step 0 (c) — when the user opts in, that orchestrator runs this skill once before phase 1, captures the resulting path, and threads it through every subagent's prompt.

## When NOT to use

- A small branch switch with no dep churn / no DB writes — `git switch -c …` is enough.
- The project has no ignored runnable state (rare — usually means the project is so simple a worktree adds friction with no upside).
- The user is on a filesystem that doesn't support symlinks (Windows non-NTFS volumes, some corporate fileshares). Fall back to copy-only and warn the user up front.

## Inputs (Step 0 — interview)

Use `AskUserQuestion` for every finite-choice question. Open prose only when the answer is genuinely free-form.

### 0.1 — Scope of the worktree

1. **Plan-driven or freeform?** `AskUserQuestion`:
   - `Plan-driven — point me at a plan file` → ask for path; read it in the **Plan inspection** step below.
   - `Freeform — just isolate the env, no plan to consult` → skip **Plan inspection**; default every "does the feature do X?" question to "unsure → fork to be safe".

2. **Worktree name** (used as the dir name + as the suffix appended to DB names / docker project names). Default = kebab(plan's feature name) when plan-driven; else ask the user.

3. **Worktree root**. Default = `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` when the runtime (claude-code, codex) writes worktrees there; else `../<repo-name>-wt-<name>/` (a sibling dir of the main checkout, so relative-path tooling that walks up keeps working). Read `.vinta-ai-workflows.yaml` → `skills.prepare-worktree.worktree_root` for a project override.

### 0.2 — Plan inspection (when plan-driven)

Read the plan once and extract (don't ask the user to repeat what's already written):

- **New dependencies?** Scan the plan's **Data Model Changes**, **Phased Rollout**, and **Guiding Decisions** sections for `pnpm add`, `npm install`, `pip install`, `poetry add`, `cargo add`, `go get`, `Gemfile` edits. If yes → record `deps_change: true`. Drives the `node_modules` / `vendor/` / `venv/` decision in the **Inventory ignored runnable state** step.
- **Migrations / data-model changes?** Look at the plan's **Data Model Changes** section, plus `alembic`, `manage.py makemigrations`, `prisma migrate`, `knex migrate`, `goose`, `sqlx migrate`, schema files (`.sql`, `schema.prisma`, `models.py`). If yes → record `schema_change: true`. Drives the DB fork decision in the **Database fork** step.
- **New env vars?** Look for `process.env.<NEW>`, `os.environ['<NEW>']`, `.env.example` edits, `config.<new>` reads. If yes → record `env_change: true`. Drives the `.env` copy-vs-symlink decision in the **Inventory ignored runnable state** step.
- **Touches test infra?** New fixtures, factories, seed scripts, a custom `pytest` plugin, a new `vitest` setup file. If yes → record `test_infra_change: true`. Drives whether the worktree gets its own per-suite scratch dir (`tmp/`, `__snapshots__/`, `playwright-report/`).
- **New services / sidecars?** New `docker-compose.yml` entries, new background workers, a new local proxy. If yes → record `compose_change: true`. Drives the compose project name / network strategy in the **Docker / compose isolation** step.

If freeform (the **Scope** step's first answer was `Freeform`): set every flag to `true` (fork everything) — the cost is wasted disk; the cost of a wrong shared-state decision is corrupted data.

### 0.3 — Sanity checks

- `git worktree list` — current worktrees + their branches. Refuse to provision a second worktree for the same branch.
- `git status` of the main checkout — refuse to provision if main has uncommitted changes on a branch you're about to fork from, **unless** the user explicitly says "use HEAD as the worktree base" (record their answer; worktree base = `head` instead of the default `origin/<default-branch>`).
- Disk space — `df -h .` of the worktree root's filesystem. Warn if `< 2 × du -sh node_modules/` (or equivalent for the project's primary dep dir).
- Filesystem symlink support — `ln -s /tmp/test-symlink /tmp/.prepare-worktree-symlink-probe && rm /tmp/.prepare-worktree-symlink-probe`. If symlinks aren't supported, flip every "symlink" decision below to "copy" and warn the user.

## Step 1 — Create the worktree

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add -b <branch> <worktree-path> <base-ref>
```

- `<branch>` — `<worktree-name>` (or a per-plan convention from the caller; e.g. [implement-plan](../implement-plan/SKILL.md) passes `plan/<plan-id-kebab>/wt`).
- `<base-ref>` — `origin/<default-branch>` by default; `HEAD` only when the **Sanity checks** step confirmed.
- `<worktree-path>` — from the worktree-root answer in the **Scope** step.

Confirm `git worktree list` shows the new entry. From here, every command runs **inside** the worktree (`cd <worktree-path>` or pass `-C <worktree-path>` on every git call). Don't leave the user's shell in the worktree without explicit confirmation.

## Step 2 — Inventory ignored runnable state

Walk the `.gitignore` rules + repo conventions and produce a list of every ignored path the runtime depends on. Read each `.gitignore` file in the repo (root + nested) — `.gitignore` is the closest the project has to a manifest of "things the app needs but we don't commit".

Common categories (extend per project):

| Category | Typical paths | Default decision (no plan info) |
|---|---|---|
| Dep dirs | `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `venv/`, `.venv/`, `target/`, `bin/`, `obj/` | Symlink (deps_change=false) / Copy + reinstall (deps_change=true) |
| Build / cache | `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `.turbo/`, `.cache/`, `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/` | Skip (rebuilt on next run) |
| Env files | `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.envrc` | Copy (env_change=true) / Symlink (env_change=false), then mutate per the **Database fork** + **Docker / compose isolation** steps |
| Local DBs | `db.sqlite3`, `*.sqlite`, `data/`, `pgdata/`, `.localstack/` | Fork (schema_change=true) / Symlink (schema_change=false) |
| Per-machine config | `.idea/`, `.vscode/settings.json` (when ignored), `local.settings.json`, `.tool-versions` | Copy (independent edits per worktree) |
| Test artefacts | `coverage/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `__snapshots__/` (when ignored) | Skip; per-worktree fresh dirs |
| Tool state | `.terraform/`, `.serverless/`, `.aws-sam/`, `.gradle/` | Symlink (read-mostly) / Copy (changes per worktree) |
| Tracked-by-project AI tooling state | `.vinta-ai-workflows/` | Symlink (shared cache is fine across worktrees) |

Record every decision in `.vinta-ai-workflows/worktrees/<name>.yaml` (see the **Write the summary file** step) so teardown can reverse them mechanically.

### 2a — Dep dirs

`deps_change = false` → `ln -s <main>/node_modules <worktree>/node_modules` (and same for `vendor/`, `venv/`, …). Save disk + skip `pnpm install`.

`deps_change = true` → copy or reinstall:
- **Copy** (`cp -aR <main>/node_modules <worktree>/`) — fast, but only correct if the package manager doesn't keep absolute paths inside (pnpm's `node_modules/.pnpm/` stores relative symlinks → safe; some yarn PnP setups bake absolute paths → reinstall instead).
- **Reinstall** (`pnpm install`, `npm ci`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `poetry install`, `cargo build`, `go mod download`) — slow but always correct.

Default: **copy** for pnpm + npm + cargo + go; **reinstall** for poetry + venv + yarn PnP. Override per-project via `.vinta-ai-workflows.yaml` → `skills.prepare-worktree.deps_strategy: copy | reinstall`.

### 2b — Env files

`env_change = false` → `ln -s <main>/.env <worktree>/.env`. Mutations the agent makes to `.env` would leak into main — flag this in the worktree's `README.md` (written in the **Write the summary file** step).

`env_change = true` → `cp <main>/.env <worktree>/.env`. Then mutate per the **Database fork** step (DB URL) + the **Docker / compose isolation** step (compose project name).

**Compose forces a copy.** If the project uses compose, the [4a](#4a--neutralize-compose-isolation-leaks) sub-step appends `COMPOSE_FILE=…` to the worktree's `.env` — a mutation. So a compose project ALWAYS needs a copied `.env` (or a copied `.envrc`) even when `env_change = false`; a symlinked `.env` would leak the `COMPOSE_FILE` line into main. Treat "project uses compose" as an independent reason to copy `.env`.

`.env.example` is **always** symlinked — it's committed; the worktree should keep tracking it.

### 2c — Skip rules

Build / cache dirs (`dist/`, `.next/`, `__pycache__/`) — don't copy, don't symlink. Let the next `build` / `test` populate them fresh in the worktree.

Test artefact dirs (`coverage/`, `playwright-report/`) — same.

## Step 3 — Database fork (when `schema_change = true` or test DB collision is possible)

Two distinct database axes need handling:

### 3a — Dev / app database

Whatever the app reads + writes during local dev. Detect the connection string source:

1. `.env` / `.envrc` keys: `DATABASE_URL`, `POSTGRES_URL`, `MYSQL_URL`, `MONGODB_URI`, `REDIS_URL`, …
2. Project config files: `config/database.yml` (Rails), `database.ini`, `prisma/schema.prisma`'s `datasource`, `knexfile.js`, Django `settings.py`'s `DATABASES`.
3. Docker compose service env: `services.db.environment.POSTGRES_DB`.

**First, determine HOW the DB is delivered — this changes what "share" even means.** Two deliveries:

- **External server** — the DB runs on a server the worktree only *connects* to (a system Postgres, an RDS instance, a compose service the worktree does NOT boot its own copy of). Here "share" = point the worktree's connection string at the one already-running server. Fork = clone into a new DB *on that same server*.
- **Per-worktree compose stack** — the DB is delivered *through the worktree's own `docker compose up`* (a `db` service the worktree boots). Here the worktree runs its **own server process**. "Share" the way the connection-string sense means is impossible without corruption: booting a second server against the same data volume is two postmasters on one PGDATA. **For compose-delivered DBs the data volumes are ALWAYS forked, independent of `schema_change`** — see the [Neutralize compose isolation leaks](#4a--neutralize-compose-isolation-leaks) sub-step, which does the volume fork mechanically. `schema_change = false` may still let you skip *cloning main's data* into the forked volume (boot empty + migrate), but it never authorizes a shared data volume.

For each detected DB, ask the user (`AskUserQuestion`) once:

- **Fork the DB** — recommended when `schema_change = true` or when the plan's phases run destructive migrations. Strategy depends on the engine:
  - **Postgres (server-based)** — `createdb -T <main_db> <main_db>_wt_<name>` (template-clone if rights allow; else `pg_dump <main_db> | psql <main_db>_wt_<name>` after `createdb`). Update the worktree's `DATABASE_URL` to point at the forked DB. Append `?application_name=wt-<name>` so the user can grep `pg_stat_activity`.
  - **MySQL (server-based)** — `mysqldump <main_db> | mysql <main_db>_wt_<name>` after `CREATE DATABASE`.
  - **SQLite (file-based)** — `cp <main>/db.sqlite3 <worktree>/db.sqlite3`. Symlink would defeat the point.
  - **Mongo / Redis / Elasticsearch** — engine-specific clone, OR per-worktree DB name / key prefix (`REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/<index>` with a free index; `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/<db>_wt_<name>`).

- **Share the DB (don't fork)** — means share a *connection to a single already-running server*, nothing more. Only safe when the DB is an **external server** (NOT compose-delivered — see the delivery check above) AND `schema_change = false` AND there's no risk of conflicting writes. Symlink the SQLite file or point the worktree's env at the same URL. Warn explicitly: "DB shared with main checkout — destructive ops here will be visible in main." **Never read this bullet as permission to point a second per-worktree compose server at a shared data volume** — that is not sharing a connection, it is running two servers on one data directory, and it corrupts the store regardless of `schema_change`.

- **Stub the DB** — point the worktree at a fresh empty DB (`createdb <main_db>_wt_<name>` + run all migrations + seed if a seed exists). Best when the feature needs schema parity but no production data.

Record the chosen strategy + the forked DB name in the worktree summary (written in the **Write the summary file** step).

### 3b — Test database

A different beast — tests on the same engine but a different DB name (`<main_db>_test`, `test_<repo>`). Parallel worktrees running tests against the same `<main_db>_test` will overwrite each other's fixtures and produce flaky failures.

**The principle (stack-agnostic):** give the worktree its own test DB name (`<main_db>_test_wt_<name>`), inject it through whatever channel the test runner already reads (an env var or a per-worktree config override), and **never edit tracked test config in place** — a worktree-local override or an env var is safe; a change to a committed config file is one `git add -A` away from leaking into main. How each runner exposes that channel:

- **Env-var runners (`vitest` / `jest`, `go test`, `cargo test`, most CI-shaped suites)** — set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (or the suite's equivalent) per worktree and confirm the test setup reads it. Simplest case; no file edits at all.
- **Config-file runners (`pytest-django` / `pytest`)** — set `--reuse-db` per worktree via a per-worktree `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`, OR override `DATABASES['default']['NAME']` to `<main_db>_test_wt_<name>` guarded on a `WORKTREE_NAME` env var. Put the override in a `conftest_worktree.py` in the worktree — don't touch the tracked `conftest.py`.
- **Convention-based runners (Rails)** — point the `test` env's `DATABASE_URL` at `<main_db>_test_wt_<name>`.
- **Docker-compose-based test DB (any stack)** — see the **Docker / compose isolation** step below; a per-worktree compose project name fixes it.

If `test_infra_change = true` → fork the test DB unconditionally. If `false` and the user says "share is fine" → still flag the race risk; offer a one-line fix to switch later.

### 3c — Migrations against the forked DB

When the plan has migrations: run them once now against the forked DB so subsequent agent runs in the worktree don't surprise the user. Use the project's standard migration command (`pnpm migrate`, `python manage.py migrate`, `alembic upgrade head`, `prisma migrate dev`, `knex migrate:latest`).

Failure → surface the error, leave the DB un-migrated, ask the user how to proceed (skip, retry, drop and recreate the DB).

## Step 4 — Docker / compose isolation (when `compose_change = true` OR project uses compose)

If the project has a `docker-compose.yml` / `compose.yaml` / `docker-compose.override.yml`, every worktree needs **its own project name** so containers, networks, and volumes don't collide.

1. Set `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<repo>_<worktree-name>` in the worktree's `.env` (or in a `.envrc` if the project uses direnv). Then `docker compose up` inside the worktree spins a fresh container set.

   **`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` is necessary but NOT sufficient.** It namespaces containers and networks, and auto-named volumes — but it does **not** isolate two very common compose patterns: volumes declared `external: true` and/or pinned to a fixed top-level `name:`, and services with fixed host port bindings (`ports: - "5432:5432"`). A shared *database* volume is the dangerous one: two worktree stacks (or a worktree stack + main's stack) mount the same physical volume, so two server processes run against one data directory → corruption. The next sub-step closes both leaks mechanically.

2. **Neutralize compose isolation leaks** — see [4a](#4a--neutralize-compose-isolation-leaks) below. Run this whenever the project has compose, before ever booting the worktree's stack.

3. **Shared network** — if the worktree's app needs to reach services running in the *main* checkout's compose stack (a queue, a cache, a search index that's expensive to spin twice), put them on an external network:

   ```yaml
   # Add to the SAME out-of-tree override the 4a sub-step generates — NOT a
   # tracked docker-compose.override.yml at the worktree root (see 4a for why).
   networks:
     shared:
       external: true
       name: <repo>_shared
   services:
     app:
       networks:
         - shared
   ```

   Or use `network_mode: host` if the project uses that pattern. Decide once per project and record in `.vinta-ai-workflows.yaml` → `skills.prepare-worktree.compose_network: per-worktree | shared-external | host`.

4. **Linters / formatters / test runners that run inside docker** (a Dockerfile-based `pnpm test`, a `lint` target that mounts source into a sidecar container) — these MUST run with the worktree's `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`. Otherwise concurrent runs hit the same container and one wins. The standard fix: ensure the project's lint/test scripts read `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` from env instead of hard-coding it.

5. **Per-worktree volumes** — for a volume the project leaves un-named, compose auto-namespaces it by project name and it's already isolated. But projects routinely pin data volumes with `external: true` or a fixed `name:` (for good reasons of their own — you must NOT edit their committed compose to "fix" that). Those are the leaks the [4a](#4a--neutralize-compose-isolation-leaks) sub-step re-pins in a generated override. Never touch the tracked compose file to change a volume's isolation; the override is the only lever.

### 4a — Neutralize compose isolation leaks

Runs whenever the project has any compose file, before the worktree's stack is ever booted. Fully project-agnostic — every decision is driven by `docker compose config --format json`, no project / service / volume name is hardcoded.

**1. Generate the override.** Run the bundled [scripts/gen-compose-worktree-override.sh](scripts/gen-compose-worktree-override.sh):

```bash
override=$(scripts/gen-compose-worktree-override.sh \
  --main     <main-checkout-root> \
  --worktree <worktree-path> \
  --name     <worktree-name> \
  --out      <summary_dir>/<name>.docker-compose.override.yml \
  --share-volume <volkey>...)   # 0+ volumes safe to keep shared (see below)
```

The script renders the resolved config from the main checkout and, for the worktree:
- re-pins every volume that is `external: true` OR carries a fixed top-level `name:` to a **non-external, worktree-namespaced** volume (`<project>_wt_<name>_<volkey>`), so the worktree's server writes to its OWN physical volume;
- strips host port publishing from every service that publishes a fixed port (via compose's `!override []` — a plain `ports: []` **merges/appends** in Compose v2+ and would NOT strip it; verified on Docker Compose v5.1.1);
- leaves alone any volume already namespaced by project name (auto-named), and any volume the caller passes via `--share-volume` (a read-only dep/venv cache with no dep churn is safe to keep shared — the config's `shared_volumes` list feeds this arg).

The script exits non-zero with a clear message if `docker compose` is unavailable or the config doesn't parse; surface that and stop (don't boot a stack you couldn't prove is isolated).

**2. Write it OUT OF TREE and wire it in via the copied `.env`.** The override goes to `<summary_dir>/<name>.docker-compose.override.yml` (under the already-ignored `.vinta-ai-workflows/` umbrella) — **NOT** a `docker-compose.override.yml` at the worktree root. Rationale: a root `docker-compose.override.yml` is auto-loaded by compose, but it is frequently a **tracked** file (it was in the project that hit the 2026-07-17 incident); writing the generated override there pollutes the worktree diff and risks `git add -A` leaking it into main. Instead, wire it in by appending to the worktree's **copied** `.env`:

```bash
# The generator prints exactly this line (base:override) on stderr — use it verbatim.
echo "COMPOSE_FILE=<base-compose-file>:<ABSOLUTE-override-path>" >> <worktree>/.env
```

`COMPOSE_FILE` makes compose load base + override for every `docker compose` call in the worktree without touching any tracked file. The **override path must be absolute** — it lives under `<summary_dir>` (outside the worktree), so a bare basename wouldn't resolve from the worktree's compose project dir; the generator prints the absolute path for you (and on stdout, for `$(...)` capture). The base file stays relative — the worktree carries its own tracked copy. **This requires `.env` to be COPIED, not symlinked** — appending to a symlinked `.env` leaks the line into main. If the **Env files** step decided `env_change = false` (symlink), flip `.env` to a copy here (compose isolation is itself an env change) and note it in the summary. Use the exact base compose filename the generator reports (`compose.yaml` vs `docker-compose.yml`).

**3. Record the decision.** Write the per-volume fork decisions and the override path into the summary YAML's `state.compose` (see the **Write the summary file** step). The override's own `volumes:` block is the teardown manifest — each pinned `name:` is a `docker volume rm` target.

**Relation to `test_db_strategy`.** The `test_db_strategy: fork-on-schema-change` config governs the **test-DB axis only** (Step 3b — which test DB *name* the runner targets). It says nothing about compose data volumes and must **never** be read as permission to share the compose stack's volumes. Volume forking here is unconditional for compose-delivered DBs, independent of `schema_change` and independent of `test_db_strategy`.

## Step 5 — Other shared infra to fork

Quick walk-through of common gotchas. For each, follow the same fork/share pattern:

- **Redis** — pick a free DB index (`/0` … `/15`) per worktree, or per-worktree key prefix if all indices are taken.
- **Object storage / S3 / GCS** — per-worktree bucket prefix in `.env` (`S3_PREFIX=wt-<name>/`); always set, even when sharing.
- **Message queues** — per-worktree queue name suffix.
- **Search index** — per-worktree index suffix.
- **Cron / background jobs** — disable cron in the worktree's `.env` (`DISABLE_CRON=true`) unless the feature needs them. Two workers polling the same queue against a shared DB is a footgun.
- **Webhooks / dev tunnels** (ngrok, cloudflared) — each worktree needs its own tunnel hostname; if the project hard-codes one URL, document the override.

If the **Plan inspection** step inferred the plan doesn't touch any of these: symlink / share. If unsure: fork. Cheap.

## Step 5.5 — Filesystem sandbox (OS-level write guard)

Symlinking + threading the worktree path through prompts keeps *cooperative* agents in the worktree, but it's not a guarantee: a buggy agent (often a smaller model spawned for a phase) can resolve an absolute path back to the **main checkout** and silently write there. Those writes never reach the worktree's commit — they sit as uncommitted thrash in the main checkout, and the "missing" edits read as a silent agent failure. Prompt instructions don't stop it; they rely on the agent's goodwill.

The deterministic fix is to confine the *process* (not the tool) at the OS filesystem layer: make the main checkout read-only for any command run inside the sandbox, regardless of which agent CLI issues the writes. The bundled [scripts/sandbox-run.sh](scripts/sandbox-run.sh) does this — `sandbox-exec` on macOS, `bwrap` (bubblewrap) on Linux. **This process-wrapping model works for runtimes that spawn subagents as subprocesses** (`codex exec`, a `claude -p` child, a custom runner). Runtimes that run subagents **in-process** — notably claude-code's Task tool, where there's no child command to wrap — use the harness-config guard in [In-process runtimes (claude-code)](#55a--in-process-runtimes-claude-code) instead.

**Model: deny-main, allow-rest.** The whole filesystem stays writable EXCEPT the main checkout, with the worktree (and the shared `.vinta-ai-workflows` dir) punched back to writable — even though the worktree usually lives *under* the main checkout (`.claude/worktrees/<name>/`). This deliberately does **not** lock `HOME` / caches / `/tmp`, so package managers, build tools, and test runners behave exactly as unsandboxed. The only thing the cage blocks is a write to the main checkout's own tracked tree — which is exactly the bug.

Wrapper contract:

```bash
sandbox-run.sh \
  --deny  <main-checkout-root> \
  --allow <worktree-path> \
  --allow <summary_dir-and-prs-context-parent>   # the .vinta-ai-workflows dir
  -- <command> [args...]
```

The command runs with main-checkout writes blocked. A stray write fails with `Operation not permitted` (macOS) / `EROFS` (Linux) — the agent sees an ordinary error and retries against the correct path; the worktree stays the only writable copy of the repo.

**Capability probe (run here, record the result):**

```bash
command -v sandbox-exec >/dev/null && tier=enforced   # macOS
command -v bwrap        >/dev/null && tier=enforced   # Linux
# neither → tier=none (sandbox unavailable)
```

- `tier=enforced` → the OS guarantee holds. The caller ([implement-plan](../implement-plan/SKILL.md)) can downgrade its post-run stray-write check to a backstop.
- `tier=none` → no sandbox tool on this machine (locked-down CI without `bwrap`'s user-namespace support, Windows, etc.). `sandbox-run.sh` still runs the command (best-effort, unsandboxed) and prints a loud warning; prevention falls back to the caller's reactive stray-write detection. **Don't fail provisioning over this** — surface the degraded tier and continue.

Escape hatch: `VINTA_SANDBOX=off` makes the wrapper a transparent pass-through (for the rare tool that needs access the sandbox blocks). Record the achieved tier in the summary (next step) so the caller knows whether it's running guaranteed or best-effort.

**Sandbox-mode shared-state rule.** Because main is read-only inside the cage, any path the *run* writes must live in the worktree or in an `--allow`'d dir — never a symlink that resolves back into the main checkout. Two follow-ons:
- The existing `deps_change=true` → copy/reinstall logic already gives the worktree its own writable `node_modules/` when a phase installs deps; non-churn phases keep the read-only symlink (agents shouldn't write deps anyway — correct).
- The `.vinta-ai-workflows/` dir (summary YAMLs, prs-context) is shared/symlinked but **written** during a run, so it must be passed as an `--allow` path (or made a real writable dir in the worktree). Record which.

### 5.5a — In-process runtimes (claude-code)

`sandbox-run.sh` confines a **process**: it wraps the command that launches a subagent. That only works when the runtime spawns subagents as **subprocesses** (`codex exec …`, a `claude -p …` child, a custom runner) — you wrap that argv and the kernel blocks the child's main-checkout writes.

**Claude Code runs subagents in-process.** Its Task tool shares the orchestrator's OS process and tool pipeline — there's no child launch command to wrap. The guard has to live in the harness's own config instead. Two complementary layers, both bundled here, both matching the same deny-main/allow-rest model:

- **Layer A — `PreToolUse` write-guard hook** ([scripts/claude-worktree-write-guard.py](scripts/claude-worktree-write-guard.py)). A session-level `PreToolUse` hook fires for **every** tool call in the session — orchestrator **and** every in-process Task subagent — because they run through the same pipeline. This hook matches the file-editing tools (`Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit`), realpath-resolves the target, and blocks (exit 2 → the model gets the reason and retries) any write that escapes the worktree into the main checkout. Filesystem-only, **no network impact**. This is the load-bearing claude-code guard and the concrete form of implement-plan's "runtime pre-write guard hook" option.

- **Layer B — Claude Code's native OS sandbox** (opt-in). Claude Code has adopted the same OS model `sandbox-run.sh` implements (`sandbox-exec` / `bwrap`), configured via `sandbox.filesystem.denyWrite` / `allowWrite` in `settings.json` instead of a wrapper, and it applies to **Bash run inside subagents** too. Turning it on closes the one gap Layer A leaves — a write issued through **Bash** (`echo > <main>/f`), which a file-tool hook can't see. **Caveat: enabling the native sandbox also turns on network isolation**, so `pnpm install` / `git push` break unless you allow-list the registry + git-remote hosts. Without Layer B, Bash-issued stray writes fall back to implement-plan's post-run `git -C <main> status` backstop (Layer 1).

Generate both with [scripts/gen-claude-sandbox-settings.sh](scripts/gen-claude-sandbox-settings.sh):

```bash
# Layer A only (filesystem-only, no network config needed):
scripts/gen-claude-sandbox-settings.sh --worktree <worktree-path> --main <main-checkout-root>

# Layer A + B (also OS-block Bash writes; must allow-list network hosts):
scripts/gen-claude-sandbox-settings.sh --worktree <worktree-path> --main <main-checkout-root> \
  --os-sandbox --allow-domain <registry-host> --allow-domain <git-remote-host>
```

It writes `<worktree>/.claude/settings.json` (merging, not clobbering) with `<worktree>`, `<main>/.git` (git worktrees commit into the main repo's `.git` — **must** stay writable), and `.vinta-ai-workflows` punched back to writable.

**Two deployment models — settings are read at session start:**

1. **Worktree-rooted session (recommended).** Run the plan from inside the worktree (`cd <worktree> && claude`). The generated `<worktree>/.claude/settings.json` governs that session and all its Task subagents. As a bonus, claude-code's default working-directory boundary already discourages file writes above cwd, so this is belt-and-suspenders. Provision the worktree + settings **before** starting the plan session.
2. **Config in the invocation's project root.** If the orchestrator already runs in the main checkout (implement-plan's default topology), the hook + sandbox must instead live in the main checkout's `settings.json` / `settings.local.json` **before** that session starts — the native `sandbox` block in particular is read at launch and won't retroactively cage an already-running session. Provision first, then start the plan; don't expect a mid-run `use_worktree` opt-in to enable the OS sandbox for the session that requested it.

Record the achieved tier the same way as the subprocess path: `enforced` when Layer B is active (or Layer A alone if the team accepts hook-only), `none` when neither is wired.

## Step 6 — Write the summary file

`.vinta-ai-workflows/worktrees/<name>.yaml` (committed to `.gitignore` via the existing `.vinta-ai-workflows/` umbrella). Schema:

```yaml
name: <worktree-name>
path: <abs-path-to-worktree>
branch: <branch-name>
base_ref: <origin/main | HEAD>
created_at: <ISO 8601>
plan_path: <ai-plans/...>     # null when freeform
flags:
  deps_change: <bool>
  schema_change: <bool>
  env_change: <bool>
  test_infra_change: <bool>
  compose_change: <bool>
state:
  deps:

  dev_db:

    forked_name: <forked db name>   # null when share / stub
    connection_url_var: DATABASE_URL
  test_db:
    engine: ...
    strategy: fork | share
    forked_name: ...
    connection_url_var: TEST_DATABASE_URL
  compose:
    project_name: <repo>_<worktree-name>
    network_strategy: per-worktree | shared-external | host
    override_path: <summary_dir>/<name>.docker-compose.override.yml   # null when no compose
    base_compose_file: docker-compose.yml    # the base file COMPOSE_FILE prepends
    forked_volumes:                          # [] when nothing leaked; teardown removes each name
      - volume_key: pgdata                   # the compose key
        reason: external | fixed-name        # why it leaked past COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME
        forked_name: <repo>_wt_<name>_pgdata # the worktree-namespaced physical volume
    shared_volumes: [virtualenv]             # leaky volumes deliberately kept shared (--share-volume)
    ports_stripped_from: [db, cache]         # services whose fixed host ports the override removed
  other:
    redis_db_index: <int>
    s3_prefix: wt-<name>/
    cron_disabled: <bool>
  sandbox:
    tier: enforced | none          # from the Filesystem sandbox step's capability probe
    launcher: sandbox-exec | bwrap | claude-hook | claude-native-sandbox | null
    # sandbox-exec / bwrap        → subprocess runtimes via scripts/sandbox-run.sh
    # claude-hook                 → in-process (claude-code) Layer A hook only (file tools)
    # claude-native-sandbox       → in-process (claude-code) Layer A hook + Layer B OS sandbox
    # null                        → tier=none (no guard wired)
    deny: [<main-checkout-root>]   # subtree(s) made read-only inside the cage
    allow: [<worktree-path>, <main-checkout-root>/.git, <.vinta-ai-workflows-dir>]  # writable exceptions
notes: |
  <freeform — anything the user / agent should know>
```

Also drop a `WORKTREE.md` at the worktree root:

```markdown
# Worktree: <name>

Branch: `<branch>` (based on `<base-ref>`).

## What's forked vs shared
<one-line per row in `state` above>

## Write protection
Sandbox tier: `<enforced | none>` (launcher: `<sandbox-exec | bwrap | none>`).
When `enforced`, commands run via `sandbox-run.sh` cannot write to the main
checkout — only this worktree (+ `.vinta-ai-workflows`). When `none`, no OS
guard is active; the orchestrator's post-run stray-write check is the backstop.

## How to run things
- Lint: `<project lint command>` (runs inside this worktree)
- Tests: `<project test command>` (against `<test_db.forked_name>`)
- App: <`pnpm dev` / `python manage.py runserver` / …>
- DB:  <forked db name + connection url>

## Teardown
When the plan is merged / abandoned:
  git worktree remove <path>
  <drop-db command>          # if fork strategy was `fork`
  # Compose (if forked). Do NOT use `down -v` — it can also nuke SHARED volumes
  # (a fixed-name dep/venv cache). Bring the stack down, then remove only the
  # worktree-namespaced volumes the override created:
  docker compose -p <project_name> down
  docker volume rm <each state.compose.forked_volumes[].forked_name>
  rm <override_path>         # the generated out-of-tree compose override

The summary file at `.vinta-ai-workflows/worktrees/<name>.yaml` records every
decision for mechanical teardown.
```

## Step 7 — Report

One paragraph to the caller:

- Worktree path + branch.
- One line per fork decision (deps / env / dev DB / test DB / compose / other).
- **Sandbox tier** (`enforced` via `sandbox-exec` / `bwrap`, or `none`) — so the caller knows whether main-checkout writes are OS-blocked or only caught after the fact.
- Anything the user must do manually before running the app (`source .envrc`, `direnv allow`, login to a cloud CLI in the worktree, etc.).
- Teardown command.

When called from [implement-plan](../implement-plan/SKILL.md), this report becomes the orchestrator's confirmation that subagents can be spawned against the worktree path.

## Teardown

A sibling skill / explicit command — not auto-run by this skill. Steps:

1. Confirm no uncommitted changes in the worktree (`git -C <path> status`).
2. `git worktree remove <path>` (or `--force` after explicit confirmation if the user is fine losing work).
3. Drop the forked DB (`dropdb <forked_name>`, `DROP DATABASE`, `rm <sqlite-file>`, …) — read the strategy from the summary YAML.
4. Compose teardown (read `state.compose` from the summary YAML):
   - `docker compose -p <project_name> down` — **not `down -v`**; a bare `down -v` also removes shared volumes (a fixed-name dep/venv cache in `state.compose.shared_volumes`), which belong to main.
   - `docker volume rm <forked_name>` for each entry in `state.compose.forked_volumes` — these are the worktree-only volumes the generated override created; removing them is safe and leaves main's / shared volumes untouched.
   - `rm <state.compose.override_path>` — delete the generated out-of-tree override.
5. Remove `.vinta-ai-workflows/worktrees/<name>.yaml`.

Every step gated on user confirmation when the worktree has un-pushed branches.

## Rules

- **Symlink for reads, copy for writes, fork for state.** This is the only mental model that scales. Default to fork when unsure — disk is cheap, corrupted main-checkout DBs are not.
- **Never share a writable DB across worktrees by default.** The race conditions are subtle and the failure mode is silent data corruption.
- **`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` does not isolate `external:`/fixed-`name:` volumes or fixed host ports — always run the [4a](#4a--neutralize-compose-isolation-leaks) generator.** For a compose-delivered DB the data volumes are forked *unconditionally* (independent of `schema_change` and `test_db_strategy`): the worktree runs its own server, and two servers on one volume is corruption. "Share the DB" only ever means share a connection to a single already-running server, never a second server on shared storage. The fix is a generated, out-of-tree override + a `COMPOSE_FILE` line in the copied `.env` — never an edit to any tracked compose file. Verify the volume-differs invariant before declaring the worktree runnable.
- **Every fork decision lands in `.vinta-ai-workflows/worktrees/<name>.yaml`.** Teardown reads it; humans grep it; agents resuming a stalled plan read it. No decision lives only in conversation memory.
- **Worktree root governed by runtime conventions.** claude-code uses `.claude/worktrees/`; other harnesses use sibling dirs. Don't fight the harness — match it.
- **Don't mutate the main checkout from this skill.** Every write goes to the worktree or to `.vinta-ai-workflows/`. Forking a Postgres DB is the one exception (the new DB lives in the same server) — document it loudly in the summary.
- **Sandbox is the deterministic guard; the prompt is not.** When a sandbox tool exists, the [Filesystem sandbox](#step-55--filesystem-sandbox-os-level-write-guard) step's `sandbox-run.sh` makes the main checkout read-only for any spawned command — this is what actually *prevents* stray main-checkout writes for subprocess runtimes. For **in-process** runtimes (claude-code's Task tool) there's no subprocess to wrap: wire the `PreToolUse` hook (+ optional native OS sandbox) from [In-process runtimes (claude-code)](#55a--in-process-runtimes-claude-code) into the session's `settings.json` instead. Telling the agent "stay in the worktree" is best-effort only either way. Always probe + record the tier; never claim prevention when `tier=none`.
- **`<main>/.git` stays writable in every model.** Git worktrees store their commits in the main repo's `.git`; a deny that also blocks `<main>/.git` breaks every commit made inside the worktree. `sandbox-run.sh` callers and the generated claude-code settings must both `--allow` / `allowWrite` `<main>/.git`.
- **Deny-main, allow-rest — never allow-worktree-only.** Locking everything except the worktree breaks package managers / caches / `$HOME`. Lock only the main checkout subtree; re-allow the worktree (nested under it) and the written `.vinta-ai-workflows` dir. Don't tighten further without testing the project's real lint / test / build / migrate commands inside the cage.
- **Worktree base = `origin/<default-branch>` by default.** `HEAD` only when the user explicitly confirms; record the choice in the summary.
- **Refuse to provision a second worktree for the same branch.** Git enforces this — don't try to work around it.
- **Don't auto-install heavy deps** (e.g. `pnpm install` from scratch) without confirmation when the project's main `node_modules/` is already populated — symlink first, ask if reinstall is needed.

## Pitfalls

- **Symlinking `node_modules` for a `pnpm add` phase.** The new package writes back through the symlink into the main checkout's store. Detect dep churn in the **Plan inspection** step and copy/reinstall instead.
- **Forking the dev DB but forgetting the test DB.** Tests still hit the shared test DB and stomp on parallel worktrees' fixtures. Both axes need their own decision in the **Database fork** step.
- **Forgetting `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`.** Containers from worktree-A overwrite worktree-B's containers; volumes get nuked. Set it in `.env` so every `docker compose` call inherits.
- **Trusting `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` to isolate `external:`/fixed-`name:` volumes and fixed host ports — it does NOT.** These defeat the project-name namespace: every worktree's compose stack mounts the SAME external/named volume and binds the SAME host port. For a DB volume that means two server processes on one data directory — the 2026-07-17 corruption incident (a worktree's `docker compose down` deleted the shared `postmaster.pid` and the main checkout's Postgres self-terminated). The fix is the [4a](#4a--neutralize-compose-isolation-leaks) generated out-of-tree override, never an edit to the tracked compose file. Verify the invariant (Verification step 6), don't assume it.
- **Confusing "share the DB" (a connection to one running server) with "share the data volume" (a second server on shared storage).** The first can be safe when `schema_change = false`; the second is always corruption. `schema_change = false` and `test_db_strategy` never authorize a shared compose data volume — see [3a](#3a--dev--app-database).
- **Writing the compose override to the worktree-root `docker-compose.override.yml`.** It's auto-loaded (convenient) but often a *tracked* file — the generated override then shows up in the diff and one `git add -A` leaks it into main. Write it under `<summary_dir>/` and wire it in via `COMPOSE_FILE` in the COPIED `.env` ([4a](#4a--neutralize-compose-isolation-leaks)).
- **Sharing a Redis DB without per-worktree prefix.** Tests writing `user:123` collide across worktrees. Pick an index OR a key prefix.
- **Copying `node_modules` for yarn PnP / absolute-path setups.** The copy carries baked-in paths from the main checkout. Reinstall instead — pnpm's relative-symlink store is the safe-to-copy exception.
- **Forgetting to `--allow` the `.vinta-ai-workflows` dir under sandbox.** It's shared/symlinked but the run *writes* it (summary YAMLs, prs-context). If it's not an `--allow` exception, those writes hit the read-only main subtree and fail mid-run. Pass it alongside the worktree path.
- **Assuming the sandbox is always there.** `bwrap` needs user namespaces enabled — some hardened kernels and CI images disable them. Probe (`command -v bwrap`); on `tier=none` degrade to the post-run check, don't silently believe writes are blocked.
- **Over-tightening into an allow-worktree-only cage.** Tempting, but it breaks every tool that writes outside the repo (npm cache, `~/.config`, `$TMPDIR`). The deny-main model is the one that needs no per-stack allowlist tuning.
- **Leaving cron / background workers on in the worktree.** They poll the shared DB and double-process jobs. Default to off.
- **Provisioning a worktree, running migrations, then realizing the user wanted to share the DB.** The **Database fork** step asks BEFORE migrating; rollback of a forked-DB migration is mechanical (drop the DB), but rollback of a shared-DB migration is a half-day.
- **Symlinking `.env` and then editing it.** The edit leaks into main. Copy (not symlink) the moment `env_change = true`.

## Verification

After the **Write the summary file** step writes the summary:

1. `git worktree list` shows the new entry.
2. `cd <worktree-path>` then run the project's standard lint + test commands. Both must run clean against the worktree's forked DB / env.
3. `git -C <worktree-path> status` is clean (no accidental file additions from the prep step).
4. The summary YAML parses (`python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.vinta-ai-workflows/worktrees/<name>.yaml'))"`).
5. `WORKTREE.md` exists at the worktree root with accurate fork / share annotations.
6. **Compose volume-isolation invariant (when the DB is compose-delivered).** This is the checked form of the footgun that caused the 2026-07-17 incident — do not skip it when the project boots its DB via compose. From the worktree:
   - Resolve the worktree's DB data volume: `docker compose config --format json | <read the db service's data volume `source`, then that volume's `.name`>`. Assert it **differs** from the main checkout's resolved DB volume name (run the same read in `<main-checkout-root>`). If they're equal, the override didn't take — **fail provisioning loudly**; do not proceed.
   - Boot only the DB service in the worktree (`docker compose up -d <db-service>`), then confirm the **main checkout's** DB container is still healthy/running afterward (`docker inspect`/`pg_isready` against main's DB). Bring the worktree DB back down. A main-DB disturbance here means isolation failed — fail provisioning.
7. Optional smoke test: run a single new-test command in the worktree (e.g. `pytest -x tests/health.py`) — confirms env vars resolved, DB reachable, deps importable.
